// to each other will create a complete class

		/*+ Java is an object-oriented programming language. This means, if you're not working with your
			standard primitive types like Strings, booleans, ints, you're probably working with objects.
			Objects are instances, or entities, or manifestations, (however you like to think of it) of any
			thing you can think of. The way
			we define our objects, or write our blueprint for our object, is through creating a class.
			This way we're able to give our object state (variables) and behavior (functions/methods). */

		// Step 1
		class Robot {

		}
		//@ Here we create a class called Robot. Right now it doesn't have any functionality or state,
		//@ because we haven't given it any.

		//+

		// Step 2
		public Robot {
			public Robot() {

			}
			//+ This is the constructor method. It's a special method because it's the same name as the
			//+ class. This is how we can create an instance of our Robot class. Even if you don't write
			//+ a constructor, Java just uses an empty constructor like we just wrote, which is why
			//+ we were able to write line 26_______________________________________________________
